# Contributing to TCDFx

We love to see the community taking a part in the development and evolution of the TCD Framework. This document's goal is to make contributing to this project as simple and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug or other issue.
- Discussing the current state of the code.
- Submitting a bug fix.
- Proposing a new feature.
- Becoming a maintainer or a [tacdevel](https://github.com/tacdevel) member.

## Development using GitHub

We use [GitHub](https://github.com)'s services to host our code, track issues and releases, and accept code changes via pull requests.

### Pull Requests

Once TCDFx v1.0.0 is released, we will use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html). This means that all code changes will happen via pull requests.

<!-- As of the release of TCDFx v1.0.0, we use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html). This means that all code changes happen through pull requests. -->
