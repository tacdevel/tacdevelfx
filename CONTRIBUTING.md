# Contributing to TCDFx

We love to see the community taking a part in the development and evolution of the TCD Framework. This document's goal is to make contributing to this project as simple and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug or other issue.
- Discussing the current state of the code.
- Submitting a bug fix.
- Proposing a new feature.
- Becoming a maintainer or a [tacdevel](https://github.com/tacdevel) member.

We use [GitHub](https://github.com)'s services to host our code, track issues and releases, and accept code changes via pull requests.

## Pull Requests

Once TCDFx v1.0.0 is released, we will use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html). This means that all code changes will happen via pull requests.

<!-- As of the release of TCDFx v1.0.0, we use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html). This means that all code changes happen through pull requests. -->

Submitting a pull request is easy. Just follow the steps below:

1. Fork the repository and create a new branch off of `master`
2. If there is testable code, add tests (if you know how to write them)
3. If you have changed/added any public APIs, update the corresponding documentation.
4. Ensure to run all tests (if any) and make sure they pass.
5. Make sure your documentation follows our [coding styles](#coding-styles)
6. [Submit your pull request](https://github.com/tacdevel/tcdfx/pull/new)!

### Coding Styles

Basic guidelines are listed below:

* Spaces, not tabs
* 4 spaces per tab
* No trailing whitespace (including a new line at the end of a file)

For the most part, everything should be formatted as per the suggestions in the error list in either Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code, since we use an `.editorconfig` file.

## Issue Reporting

Reporting an issue is even easier than submitting a pull request. Just follow the steps below to write and report an issue/bug:

1. [Write a descriptive issue and submit](https://github.com/tacdevel/tcdfx/issue/new)!
    - Provide a summary of the issue you would like to report.
    - Explain what should have happened.
    - Explain what actually happens.
    - Show the steps you need to take to reproduce the problem. be as specific as you can, and provide sample code if possible.
    - Add any additional notes, including operating system information.

## Contribution Licensing

When you submit a pull request or issue, your submissions are understood to be under the same [license](https://github.com/tacdevel/tcdfx/blob/master/LICENSE.md) that covers the project. Feel free to contact a project maintainer if that is a concern.
